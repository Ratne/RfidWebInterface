#Rfid Web Interface 


An easy java rfid interface that works between a browser and a wireless antenna through the use of Apache Tomcat 

**The “.war” file is included** in the package; after deployed it and set the ip address of the uhf reader going, from a browser, @ localhost/Rfid3/param  you’ll be able to obtain the rfid tag readed by the antenna thanks to the “.json” file located in the localhost/Rfid3 position
